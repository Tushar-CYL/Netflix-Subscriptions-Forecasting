Netflix Subscription Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis

Time series forecasting is a powerful technique that helps businesses like Netflix predict future trends, such as the number of new subscribers. By analyzing historical data, Netflix can estimate growth potential, improve operational efficiency, and make better decisions about finances and content strategy. This guide will walk you through the process of forecasting Netflix subscriptions using Python.

Here’s the step-by-step process we’ll follow:

Collect Historical Data: Gather data on Netflix’s past subscription growth.

Preprocess and Clean the Data: Prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values and inconsistencies.

Explore Time Series Patterns: Analyze trends, seasonality, and other patterns in the data.

Select a Forecasting Model: Choose a suitable model like ARIMA or LSTM for time series forecasting.

Train the Model: Use the training dataset to build the model.

Forecast Future Subscriptions: Predict the number of subscribers for future time periods.

To get started, you’ll need a dataset containing historical Netflix subscription data. I’ve found a suitable dataset for this task, which you can download from [here].

In the sections below, I’ll guide you through the process of Netflix subscription forecasting using time series analysis and Python. By the end, you’ll have a clear understanding of how to predict subscription growth and apply these techniques to real-world business scenarios.
